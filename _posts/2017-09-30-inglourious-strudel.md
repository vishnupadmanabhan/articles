I have been a believer in the **Law of Attraction (LOA)** for a few years. In fact, that is the only thing I really believe in. I am not a typical follower of fantasies and myths. But this is something that has been with me for few years and has worked wonders for me. Some small and simple things, other big and complex. But in every way, LOA has worked wonders.

After learning about LOA back in the year 2009 after reading the book [The Secret](https://www.amazon.in/Secret-Rhonda-Byrne/dp/1847370292){:target="_blank"}, I understood why certain things happened a certain way in my life up to that point. Ever since I have also had control over the situations I have been through by applying the principles in my life and have seen unbelievable results.

I am not gonna make this an exceptionally long post by listing out those specific instances in my life where LOA has worked for me, but I would be happy to talk to you about it if you are interested. You know where to find me. :wink:

Let's talk about the image you see above. It is a dish called *[Strudel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strudel){:target="_blank"}* and is an Austrian delicacy. If you are a *Quentin Tarantino* fan and have closely watched all his movies, this should bring back some memories from one of his classic movies. Still thinking? Well, remember this scene from *Inglourious Basterds* where *Shosanna* (played by beautiful Melanie Laurent) finds herself at a table in a restaurant with the Nazi *Hans Landa* (Christoph Waltz) from whom she fled years before after he murdered her family?

I have watched this scene several times. Not just because it has Melanie in it, but I have always wished I get a taste of that Strudel. Every time the characters take a bite, I imagined the taste in my mouth. I have never seen any place in Bangalore that makes Strudel in spite of doing quite a bit of searching.

Just a couple of nights ago, I was watching this scene as it popped on my YouTube suggested video list. I watched it again wondering how it might taste. I imagined the crisp pastry and the sweetness of the powdered sugar topping. In my mind, I was actually feeling the feeling of having it!

I thought to myself, is there a way I could attract this and taste it? Well, I left the thought to the universe to take care and did not worry about it. The important thing to note here is that I imagined the thought and felt the feeling of actually having it. This is the core of LOA. Then not worrying about it, I left the thought.

Last night, I went out for dinner to a restaurant where I have never been before. As we were ordering the starters from the menu, I saw another set of items on a different menu which was kept at the centre of the table. I can hardly explain my feelings as I read through and find there listed on the menu the very same thing that I had imagined eating just a night before.

Yes, it was on the menu. I told my friends about my experience and immediately ordered it. I finally got my very own **Strudel**! It may sound like a mere coincidence, but I refuse to believe so. I have had very pleasant experiences practising LOA and I believe this to be one instance as well. I had a great time enjoying my strudel and the taste was as I imagined and the only difference was that Shosana had her strudel with cream where I had with ice-cream, but I am not complaining!
