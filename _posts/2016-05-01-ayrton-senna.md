> Being second is to be the first of the ones who lose.
<br > - Ayrton Senna 

The above quote clearly says lot about the attitude of the master racer. He was ruthless. He raced to win and nothing else. He was loved and hated, but even people who hated him, admired his talent. Millions worshiped him and in his native Brazil he was The Hero. Off the track he was an amazing human being, helping others and feeling for his country and people, on track he was a feared competitor.

**He was a legend, and still is.**

Some might say that his greatness is overrated and that there are some better drivers than him. But numbers do not mean everything in Formula One for a fan. That is why Ayrton Senna, a triple world champion, is often viewed by many as being the greatest of all time even though Juan Manuel Fangio, Alain Prost and Michael Schumacher have won more titles than him.

But that doesn't mean he did not excel in numbers as well. He started 161 races, with 65 pole positions, and 41 race wins. He was on the podium 80 times and was world champion in 1988, 1990 and 1991.

Senna was unique. His passion and aggression was one of a kind that was never seen before. His attention to detail made him a master of driving under all conditions. One case in the point happened in Donington during the 1993 season. On April 11<sup>th</sup>, 1993, Senna drove what many consider to be the [F1's Greatest Lap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GOEorrE4mY).

If you watch the video, it gives a brief glimpse into the his standard of driving. One moment he will be making an aggressive move on his opponent only to take him off the track, the other moment he will [get out of the car in traffic to see if fellow driver is okay after a crash](https://youtu.be/jVHiUZCxP8o?t=1m47s). This showed his human side and how on the race track he can still be a great human being.

Even after 22 years, today's driver's are in [awe of his driving skills](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cli2XEoca24). Just look at Hamilton's reaction, he being a great driver himself. He was a believer in god and thought that **he had a god given right to win**.

>I have no idols. I admire work, dedication and competence.
<br > - Ayrton Senna

He might have had no heroes, but for many, he was the hero. But the wonderful life of the greatest driver was cut short, and it deeply hurts me that he is not alive to see today. How would Formula 1 in the nineties be if he was alive, we would never know. What would he think of the evolution of the sport? If there is something as heaven, for sure he would be racing there as well. He died doing what he loved to do the most - Racing. So wherever he is, he would see millions inspired through his life.

You are a hero Ayrton. You still are and will ever be. Wish things were different on [1<sup>st</sup> May, 1994 at Imola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Ayrton_Senna).

> Because in a split second, it's gone.
